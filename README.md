# explodableBushes
A mod for Stardew Valley that allows for bushes to be exploded.

"explodableBushes" offers an basic way to get rid off Bushes via explosions, however once destroyed they will never respawn.
It's more to mess around with, rather than to offer actual proper functionality like "destructibleBushes".
Bushes will drop a handful of Wood, Fiber and drop the item they had like Salmonberry if present.
This mod is more of a "proof of concept" since I wanted to test "Harmony" and it will most likely never see any updates.
I decided to upload it if someone wants to have a look at a "barebones" example of patching a single game function and to get
a bit more familiar with GitHub and NexusMods.
